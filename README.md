•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is very important when you are starting a brand-new program. If the user needs are not met, your program will not be successful.
You can interpret these needs by creating a user story. Creating user stories helps with this because you can identify who the user is, what their ideas are,
and what main functions they are looking for in your program. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I would approach developing programs by creating a pseudo code to ensure I was creating everything the user wanted to happen 
in their user story. I would then ensure I am holding scrum meetings to let the user and other members of the team know where
we are with the project, if there are any bugs in the project, or if any changes need to be made. I would also use sprints during the
project. Each sprint would be short and focused on one or two small goals. This would ensure I stay focused on the task at hand and not 
the final project in its entireity.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development means you have great communication skills, both verbally and in your code. 
When you are writing your code, ensure to also include what you expect your code to do. You must do this in the event another
software developer needs to fix or make a change within your code, to understand what it is trying to do just by reading it.

Actively contributing to the teams discussions is vital in effective communication as well. If there is a task the team needs 
to overcome, sharing your knowledge will help the team come up with a solution. Supporting your team mates if they have a problem, 
as well as be willing to help with anything you are able to. 

These characteristics in being a good team member will improve quality, build strong team morale, as well as contribute to 
faster problem solving.
